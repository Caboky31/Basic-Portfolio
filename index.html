                        This is first college level class that I have taken. I'm looking forward to developing my skills and using them to make a
                        living. I don't like talking about myself. I would prefer to tell a story of things I have done.
                        I haven't been to very many places and I hope to change that, my goal is to go to a new country every
                        year. In my free time I like to hang out at the beach or go hiking. I enjoy being active.
